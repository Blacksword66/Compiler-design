# This directory contains Assessment 1 codes for Compiler Design Lab
## Experiment 1:
Implementation of Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) from regular grammar  using C language.

## Experiment 2:
- Implement a DFA in LEX code which accepts Odd number of 0’s and even number of 1’s. 
- DFA in LEX code which accepts strings over {0, 1} ending with 11.

## How to execute (for linux and macOS only):

#### For C code
```shell
gcc file.c 
./a.out

```

#### For Lex Code 
```shell
lex file.l 
gcc lex.yy.c 
./a.out

```
